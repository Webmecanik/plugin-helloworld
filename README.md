# Hello World
This is a sample plugin built for Mautic 3 using the integrations framework included in core that was originally based on the [Integrations plugin](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations).

An example for Mautic 2 for the Oauth2 client credentials grant can be found [here](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-helloworld/tree/mautic-2).
An example for Mautic 3 for the Oauth2 authorization code grant can be found [here](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-helloworld/tree/mautic-3-authorization-code-grant-example).

This can be used as an example in combination with the [Integrations plugin wiki](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations/wiki).

This plugin has examples for:

* Plugin migrations
* OAuth2 authorization code grant
* Configuration UI interfaces
* Syncing Mautic contacts and companies

There is an example for the OAuth2 client credentials grant [here](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-helloworld/tree/mautic-3).

## Mocked Responses
The following places have mocked code to simulate a working plugin:

- \MauticPlugin\HelloWorldBundle\Connection\Client::getClient()
- \MauticPlugin\HelloWorldBundle\Connection\MockedHandler
- \MauticPlugin\HelloWorldBundle\Controller\Mocks\*

## Code Expectations and Standards
This plugin also tries to exemplify code standards and expectations. 
* Code should be clean (see [https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php](https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php))
* Code should be well covered with unit and/or functional tests
* Code should meet CS standards (includes `symplify/easy-coding-standard` which can be ran with `composer fixcs`)
* Code should pass phpstan standards (run `composer phpstan`)
